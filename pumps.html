            <h2>Pump Sets</h2>
            
            

            <p>Similar to the boilers. This are normally wire the same and the pump will control itself to maintain the set flowrate (commission in the pumps VDS) and the BMS just gives enables.</p>
            
            <p>This can be done on analogue output 2 or 3RMs or digital outputs to the pumps.</p>
            
            <p>Some sets need pressure control that BMS will look after but then it would have enables and an analogue speeds or just the speed and they are always enabled.</p>

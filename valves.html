            <h2>Valves</h2>
            <p>When is a valve open, closed or letting by?</p>
            
            <h3>What is Letting by?</h3>
            <p>Letting by is when the valve states it closed but water is still flow through it causing it heat or cool when it should not be easy way to tell the flow to temperature be it hot or cold water is heating the flow from</p>
            
            <h3>Valve percentages</h3>
            <p>Generally if a valve a 2 port (some 3 port) are under 15% they are not doing anything anyway most valve don’t let water through until 20% open.</p>

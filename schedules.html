            <h2>Time Schedules and OSS</h2>
            
            <p>If the builds state open hours of 7 til 7 m-f but the plant run out of this range, this may be OSS or that the control TS is not at the same time. As the state time on edge.</p>

            

            <h3>Optimised Start Stop (OSS)</h3>
            <p>In Trend the default OSS has a warmup is 360 min this is 6 hours. The OSS if the OAT is 15⁰C and the office space is 20⁰C with a SP of 21⁰C the OSS will send a warmup run command to start all the plant connect an amount of time before the time schedule stated time.</p>
            
            <p>You can also have cooldown so if the SP is 21⁰C and the space temp is 22⁰C and the OSS has worked out that if the TS turn off at 5pm and that the building stays above 21⁰C for an hour after 5pm the off will ask for the equip turn of an hour before 5pm.</p>

            <h3>Trend Time zone on N4</h3>

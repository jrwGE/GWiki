            <h2>Variable Drive Speeds (VDS)</h2>
            <p>With VDS (variable drive speeds) or invertors as they are sometimes called, the enable means very little it just mean start but it could be started a 0%/0volts.</p>
            
            <p>In the VDS there will be a max Hz set the will equal 100% 10volts this could be 50hz (or the max rating of the equipment or more then likely a reduce value set be they air balancing as a min and max for air quality.</p>
            
            <h3>If VDS is running 100% for a long time:</h3>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>That there are issues onsite with open duct work.</li>
                <li>The AHU (air handling unit) is under sized this can be that item have change or add since build/fit out.</li>
                <li>Motor or blades of the fan are failing, and it has to run faster to achieve the same state.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At 100% for long periods this point the VDS is adding more losses due to inefficiencies, which can be as much as 10%.</p>

            <h3>100% Loss</h3>
            <p>In VDS in AHU you can run them down to 10 - 15% and the fan would be hardly moving. This is fine as long as the CO₂ PPM is still below 900 PPM. What you may find is with lowering the VDS to this speed that you are saving 20% on the VDS but it is no longer doing its job. So it is effectively a 100% loss because the 0-20% VDS is not able to keep the airflow high enough to keep the PPM below 900.</p>

            <h2>Air Handling Units (AHU)</h2>
            <p>Some time the AHU will be a packaged unit in the case the BMS will give an Enabled and a setpoint. You will get back lots of different value these will be input form the packed unit or additional sensor that have been added.</p>

            <h3>Dampers</h3>
            <p>Dampers have end switches these are an open closed signal that tell you in the damper is opened or closed. They break a lot, they also get set up wrong so always take them with a pinch of salt. They are normally controlled by and interlink in the control panel when the fan in enabled and the fan start once they are open.</p>
            
            

            <h3>Coils</h3>
            <p>Frost, Cooling, Heating can by Wet, Electric or Gas. Normal 0-10v.</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>If the off/after sensor of the coil is reading hotter then the intel side and the valve or % is 0 the valve will be LETTING BY (not closing properly).</li>
                <li>If they are give a % and the temperature changes they are okay Gas and Electric and normal quicker to react the Wet, but they both have tendency to overshoot as they are hard to control.</li>
                <li>Both gas and electric should never run if the fan is not working.</li>
            </ul>

            

            <h3>Thermal wheels</h3>
            <p>Some ahu have thermal wheels that can be used instead of frost coils I have always set them to 20 RPM but some time they are on VDS, I personal do see much point on running any slower or faster then 20 RPM but happy to discuss.</p>
            
            

            <h3>Fans (When is a fan running?)</h3>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>The fan is enabled and the DPS is made (true or 1) or flow sensor has a positive number it is running.</li>
                <li>The fan is disable and the DPS is made (true or 1) or flow sensor has a positive number it is running.</li>
                <li>The fan is disable and the DPS is made (true or 1) or flow sensor has a positive number, but the off-coil temperature is really high (close to the feed/flow temperature of the CT) the fan is NOT running.</li>
                <li>The fan is enabled and the DPS is made (true or 1) or flow sensor has a positive number but the off-coil temperature is really high (close to the feed/flow temperature) the fan is NOT running.</li>

            <h2>Understanding Enables</h2>
            <p>In the BMS the enable is generally just a please run signal to the equipment. Most run hour is just how long has it been enabled for.</p>
            
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>To get true run time you need a DPS (differential pressure switch) or flow meter/sensor however these are sometime not installed due to cost.</li>
                <li>Some have current switches, but these just prove that power is being drawn. If the pump or fan is broken it can be drawing power but not moving.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> BMS is saying that a pump is enabled but it is off on the panel. The enabled signal will be on in the controller regardless. So you would need to look at some sort DPS/Flow or current switch for the purpose of Virtual Metering.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Some DPS/flow and current switch are common across the set; with boilers they don’t normally have DSP/flow and you can only go by the temperature increasing. If DPS are showing flow and the fan or pump is show as disabled the equipment maybe running in Hand/overridden on manually.</p>
